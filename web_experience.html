            <h2>Web Development Journey</h2>
            <p>This assignment marks my first formal experience with web development, and I am eager to dive into the world of HTML, CSS, and other web technologies. While I am new to this field, I’m excited to explore how these technologies work together to create functional and visually engaging websites. My immediate goal is to develop a strong foundation in front-end development, focusing on building structured web pages and designing user-friendly interfaces.</p>

            <p>As I progress, I plan to expand my skills by learning JavaScript and eventually exploring more advanced tools like React or Bootstrap. I understand that web development is constantly evolving, and I look forward to applying what I learn to future projects, improving my abilities with each step. This journey is just beginning, and I’m ready to embrace the challenges and opportunities it brings.</p>
