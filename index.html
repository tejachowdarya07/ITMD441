        <h2> About Me</h2>
        <p> Hello! This is Lakshmi Sai Teja Suryadevara, currently pursuing a Master's degree in Information Technology and Management. My academic journey began in the world of chemistry, where I developed a strong foundation in scientific thinking, research, and problem-solving. However, as technology continues to reshape industries and open new doors, I decided to embark on a new adventure in Information Technology.</p>

        <p>The transition from chemistry to IT has been both challenging and exhilarating. In chemistry, I learned the importance of precision, analysis, and methodical experimentation. These skills have surprisingly translated well into the tech world, where attention to detail and logical reasoning are key to solving complex problems.</p>

        <p>In this course, I am excited to dive deeper into the field of web development. Through my lab work and projects, I aim to strengthen my understanding of front-end and back-end technologies, expand my design skills, and experiment with creating dynamic, user-friendly websites. Each project I build will reflect not only my growing technical skills but also my passion for blending creativity with functionality.</p>

        <p>I look forward to sharing my progress and learning as I continue on this exciting path, building a bridge between my scientific roots and the fast-paced, ever-evolving world of information technology.</p>
